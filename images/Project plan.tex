\section{Project Plan}
\subsection{\textbf{Background}}
On the third year of Information Security courses the students can choose a non mandatory class called "Ethical hacking and penetration testing" The course teaches the students how to safely perform a penetration test and document their finding. The creation of PEMA is going to allow these students to perform penetration tests and different tasks online on a simulated environment with simulated constraints and assess how well they perform. 

\subsection{\textbf{My background}} 
I am a student in the process of  achieving my bachelor in information security at NTNU. 

\subsection{\textbf{Related work}} 
The website could be comparable to Capture the flag competitions where a user is meant to solve challenges that are presented to them and progress through the competition. The difference between that and PEMA is that the CTF is not meant to teach you, PEMA is going to provide a learning experience to the experienced and beginner students by invoking the hint system and providing a step by step explanation why something works and how it works.

\subsubsection{\textbf{Comments to the Gantt chart}}
Some of the Tasks are not mandatory to complete such as chat and monitoring which can be implemented at any time without a loss to the person using the website. 
Tho they are within the limits of what I want to achieve until the deadline and will attempt to do so, but if problems arrise they are the first ones to be cut from the finished project.
